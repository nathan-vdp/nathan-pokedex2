## Clone the Repository

To clone the repository, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone git@git.nexed.com:deepdive-pokedex/pokedex-deepdive.git
```

## Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project's root directory and install the required dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
cd pokedex
npm install
```

This project uses Vite with Svelte and Tailwind, so the installation process may take a few moments to download and set up the necessary packages.

## Run the Application Locally

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application locally with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server, and you can access the Pokedex web application by opening your browser and navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).


Happy exploring, and catch 'em all! ðŸš€
