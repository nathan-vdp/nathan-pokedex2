# Pokedex README

> **Important Notice**: This project was initially developed as part of a school coding competition within a private repository. It was later imported to GitHub, which means that the vast majority of the Git commit history is not available here. However, we have however documented our individual contributions in this README to provide insight into the development process.


Welcome to our Pokedex project! This web application allows users to explore and learn about different Pokemon, their types, abilities, and more. To get started, follow the instructions below.

## Individual Contributions

This project was a collaborative effort by Saman, Nathan, Jair, and Youssef. Here's a brief overview of what each person contributed:

- **Saman**: Made both main page and pokedex entry page based on Nathan's wiresframes, complete with search and filter functionality, stats, moves, shiny toggle and evolution chain
- **Nathan**: Used his previous Pokedex project as a base, made navbar, made wireframes, and added some styling to the PokÃ©dex entry page
- **Jair**: Did some styling on navbar and added SCSS
- **Youssef**: Added konami code easter egg to project with functional Pokemon FireRed emulation, helped a lot with brainstorming

## Clone the Repository

To clone the repository, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone git@git.nexed.com:deepdive-pokedex/pokedex-deepdive.git
```

## Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project's root directory and install the required dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
cd pokedex
npm install
```

This project uses Vite with Svelte and Tailwind, so the installation process may take a few moments to download and set up the necessary packages.

## Run the Application Locally

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application locally with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server, and you can access the Pokedex web application by opening your browser and navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).


Happy exploring, and catch 'em all! ðŸš€
